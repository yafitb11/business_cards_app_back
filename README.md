# REST API Project – Node.js + MongoDB

A clean and modular **RESTful API** built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  
This project includes **user authentication, role-based authorization, and business card management**, demonstrating best practices in backend development.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **User Management**: Register, login, get user/s profile, update, change business status, delete  
- **Business Cards**: Get all cards / one card / my cards, create, update, like, and delete  
- **Authentication**: JWT-based login with role handling (admin, business, regular user)  
- **Password Security**: Passwords hashed with **bcryptjs**  
- **Validation**:  
  - Request validation with **Joi** (client input)  
  - Schema validation with **Mongoose** (database layer)  
- **Logging**:  
  - Console logging with **Morgan**  
  - File logging for errors (status ≥ 400) – *bonus feature*  
- **Business Number Control**: Admin can change business numbers (ensures uniqueness) – *bonus feature*  
- **Environment Config**: Managed with the **config** package  
- **Supports two environments**:  
  - **Development** → connects to MongoDB local compass  
  - **Production** → connects to MongoDB Atlas  

### 📌 Note:
For security reasons, the real **production config file** (with Atlas username & password) was **not pushed to Git**.  
Instead, a **dummy config file** is included so the structure remains visible without exposing credentials.
